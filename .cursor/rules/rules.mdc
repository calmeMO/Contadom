Always consult the database to understand the current context and detect possible changes to avoid errors. This ensures you know whether migrations are necessary.

Analyze the existing code before making changes, as this is an accounting cycle project where each module depends on another.

Only use libraries that are essential for the project to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
